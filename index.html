            <p class="text-muted text-left">I went to the Disney World in Florida. It was awesome! I went to all four main Disney lands on different days and years. First, I went to Magic Kingdom. There were fantastic fireworks at the end! Then, I went to Epcot. I went on mini boat rides and my favorite ride was Soaring! It was so cool. You feel like your soaring in the sky, but you are just sitting and basically watching TV. Next, I went to Animal Kingdom. The Everest ride was the best! It was going up and down Mt. Everest, but there were train tracks that were "broken" and "Yeti's". There was a part where we went backwards. Last, I went to Hollywood Studios. There was an epic fall on the Tower of Terror! Overall, Disney World was amazing.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">I went to Myrtle Beach in South Carolina with my friend. I went there in my car with my friend. We were playing word games and listening to music. As we were nearing our hotel, we were yelling and singing in the car. In the hotel, we were playing a very random game with the suitcase trolley. The next day, we went to the hotel swimming pool and went down a mega slide! We went to the beach and sat by the water. It was very fun. After that, we washed off and went to downtown to go on a ferris wheel ride! We could see the ocean from high in the sky. We went to the pier and enjoyed great sea food. That was the end of the day.</p>

                <p>I saw with my friends at a sleepover. It was really fun and nice, except for how two of them kept talking. The movie was very good. There was no romance and drama. At least the romance only went till holding hands. It is a very appropriate movie for kids.</p>

            <p>Pressured by parents with opposing views on when Maryland’s largest school system should reopen classrooms amid the pandemic, Montgomery County officials stayed the course with a plan to return starting next month.The plan, unanimously approved by the school board Tuesday, takes effect in March as the suburban school system of more than 160,000 students marks a full year of virtual learning.First to arrive on school campuses will be 500 students in special-education programs and 230 students who are part of five career programs that require in-person experiences for industry certifications.On March 15, the school system begins a process of phasing in all grades, with the first group including children in kindergarten through third grade, along with additional students in special programs.</p>

            <h5>U.S. toy sales jumped in 2020 as parents diverted spending to Monopoly and Barbie dolls</h5>

            <p>Hasbro Inc. and Mattel Inc. enjoyed a boost during the Covid-19 pandemic as lockdowns spurred parents to spend on everything from board games to Barbie dolls for their children. Now the toy makers are trying to determine whether new habits such as game night and playtime will remain once the pandemic subsides. They join others, from the makers of Purell hand sanitizer to Peloton bikes, in assessing their businesses. Widespread lockdowns and a lack of social interaction boosted U.S. toy sales 16% last year to more than $25 billion, according to research firm NPD Group Inc. Parents diverted spending on canceled vacations and summer camps to in-home diversions. Stimulus payments helped the industry too.</p>
